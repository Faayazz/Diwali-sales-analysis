# Diwali Sales Analysis


## üìñ Introduction

This project provides an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Diwali sales dataset. The primary goal is to uncover trends and patterns in customer purchasing behavior to derive actionable business insights. By cleaning, processing, and visualizing the data, this analysis identifies key demographics, popular product categories, and high-revenue regions.

*   **Customer Profiling:** Who are the most valuable customer segments by age, gender, marital status, and occupation?
*   **Geographic Performance:** Which states contribute the most to sales?
*   **Product Strategy:** What are the top-selling product categories?
*   **Actionable Insights:** How can these findings be used to improve sales, target marketing efforts, and manage inventory more effectively?

*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations and computations.
*   **Matplotlib:** For creating basic static visualizations.
*   **Seaborn:** For generating more advanced and aesthetically pleasing statistical plots.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** As the interactive environment for writing and presenting the code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Workflow

The project followed a structured data analysis workflow:

1.  **Data Sourcing:** Imported the dataset from the CSV file.
2.  **Data Cleaning:**
    *   Handled null values by dropping unnecessary columns and empty rows.
    *   Corrected data types for relevant columns (e.g., `Amount`).
    *   Renamed columns for better readability and consistency.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   Performed statistical analysis using the `describe()` method to get a high-level overview.
    *   Analyzed data by grouping it based on Gender, Age Group, State, Marital Status, and Occupation.
4.  **Data Visualization:**
    *   Created various charts and plots to visualize the findings and make them easy to interpret.
